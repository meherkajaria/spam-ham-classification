# spam-ham-classification

This repository contains a comprehensive project aimed at creating a binary classifier to distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. Leveraging real-world data, the project involves extensive feature engineering, data preprocessing, and the application of various machine learning models to achieve accurate classification.

The project is structured in two main parts:

Part 1: Focuses on initial exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building a baseline model using Logistic Regression.
Part 2: Involves refining the model, experimenting with different algorithms, and improving the classifier's performance through advanced techniques and error analysis.
